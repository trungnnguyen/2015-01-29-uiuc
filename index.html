<h2>General Information</h2>

<!--
  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->
<p>
  <a href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software Carpentry</a>'s mission
  is to help scientists and engineers get more research done in less
  time and with less pain by teaching them basic lab skills for
  scientific computing.  This hands-on workshop will cover basic
  concepts and tools, including program design, version control, data
  management, and task automation.  Participants will be encouraged to
  help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own
  research problems.
</p>
<p>
  The registration fee helps us to cover facility and instructor travel expenses.  Lunch, coffee, and snacks are provided.
</p>
<p>
This event is jointly sponsored by <a href="http://ncsa.illinois.edu/">National Center for Supercomputing Applications</a> and <a href="http://cse.illinois.edu/">Computational Science and Engineering</a> at the University of Illinois.
</p>

<!--
  Explain who your audience is.  (In particular, tell readers if the
  workshop is only open to people from a particular institution.
-->
<p>
  <strong>Who:</strong>
  The course is aimed at graduate students and other researchers.
  Some programming experience is preferred, as it will ease the
  application of concepts.

<div> <!-- Start of 'editor' section. -->
  <h3>Text Editor</h3>

  <p>
    When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text editor that is
    optimized for writing code, with features like automatic
    color-coding of key words.  The default text editor on Mac OS X and
    Linux is usually set to Vim, which is not famous for being
    intuitive.  if you accidentally find yourself stuck in it, try
    typing the escape key, followed by ':q!' (colon, lower-case 'q',
    exclamation mark), then hitting Return to return to the shell.
  </p>

  <div class="row-fluid">
    <div class="span4">
      <h4>Windows</h4>
      <p>
	<code>nano</code> is the editor installed by the Software
	Carpentry Installer, it is a basic editor integrated into the
	lesson material.
      </p>
      <p>
	<a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> is a
	popular free code editor for Windows.  Be aware that you must
	add its installation directory to your system path in order to
	launch it from the command line (or have other tools like Git
	launch it for you).  Please ask your instructor to help you do
	this.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
      <h4>Mac OS X</h4>
      <p>
	We recommend
	<a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">Text Wrangler</a> or
	<a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>.
	In a pinch, you can use <code>nano</code>,
	which should be pre-installed.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
      <h4>Linux</h4>
      <p>
	<a href="http://kate-editor.org/">Kate</a> is one option for
	Linux users.  In a pinch, you can use <code>nano</code>, which
	should be pre-installed.

  <h3>The Bash Shell</h3>

  <p>
    Bash is a commonly-used shell that gives you the power to do simple
    tasks more quickly.
  </p>

  <div class="row-fluid">
    <div class="span4">
      <h4>Windows</h4>
      <p>
	Install Git for Windows by download and running
	<a href="http://msysgit.github.io/">the installer</a>.
	This will provide you with both Git and Bash in the Git Bash program.
      </p>
      <h4>Software Carpentry Installer</h4>
      <p><em>This installer requires an active internet connection.</em></p>
      <p>After installing Python and Git Bash:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>
          Download the <a href="{{site.swc_installer}}">installer</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
          If the file opens directly in the browser
          select <strong>File&rarr;Save Page As</strong> to download it
          to your computer.
	</li>
	<li>
          Double click on the file to run it.
	</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
      <h4>Mac OS X</h4>
      <p>
	The default shell in all versions of Mac OS X is bash, so no
	need to install anything.  You access bash from the Terminal
	(found in
	<code>/Applications/Utilities</code>).  You may want to keep
	Terminal in your dock for this workshop.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
      <h4>Linux</h4>
      <p>
	The default shell is usually <code>bash</code>, but if your
	machine is set up differently you can run it by opening a
	terminal and typing <code>bash</code>.  There is no need to
	install anything.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
<div> <!-- End of 'shell' section. -->  

<div> <!-- Start of 'Git' section. -->
  <h3>Git</h3>

  <p>
    Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes
    to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public
    version of your code
    on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>.
  </p>

  <div class="row-fluid">
    <div class="span4">
      <h4>Windows</h4>
      <p>
	Git should be installed on your computer as part of your Bash
	install (described above).
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
      <h4>Mac OS X</h4>
      <p>
	<strong>For OS X 10.8 and higher</strong>, install Git for Mac
	by downloading and running
	<a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">the installer</a>.
	<strong>For older versions of OS X (10.5-10.7)</strong> use the
	most recent available installer for your
	OS <a href="https://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/downloads/list">available
	  here</a>.  Use the Leopard installer for 10.5 and the Snow
	Leopard installer for 10.6-10.7.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
      <h4>Linux</h4>
      <p>
	If Git is not already available on your machine you can try to
	install it via your distro's package manager. For Debian/Ubuntu run
        <code>sudo apt-get install git</code> and for Fedora run
        <code>sudo yum install git</code>.
      </p>

  <h3>Python</h3>

  <p>
    <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> is a popular language for
    scientific computing, and great for general-purpose programming as
    well.  Installing all of its scientific packages individually can be
    a bit difficult, so we recommend an all-in-one installer.
  </p>

  <div class="row-fluid">
    <div class="span4">
      <h4>Windows</h4>
      <ul>
	<li>
          Download and
          install <a href="https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/">Anaconda</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
          Use all of the defaults for installation
          <em>except</em> make sure to check <strong>Make Anaconda the

	(Installation requires using the shell and if you aren't
	comfortable doing the installation yourself just
	download the installer and we'll help you at the boot
	camp.)
      </p>
      <ol>
	<li>
          Download the installer that matches your operating
          system and save it in your home folder.
	</li>
	<li>
          Open a terminal window.
	</li>
	<li>
          Type <pre>bash Anaconda-</pre> and then press
          tab. The name of the file you just downloaded should
          appear.
	</li>
	<li>
          Press enter. You will follow the text-only prompts.  When
          there is a colon at the bottom of the screen press the down
          arrow to move down through the text. Type <code>yes</code> and
          press enter to approve the license. Press enter to approve the
          default location for the files. Type <code>yes</code> and
          press enter to prepend Anaconda to your <code>PATH</code>
          (this makes the Anaconda distribution the default Python).
